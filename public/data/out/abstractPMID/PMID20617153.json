However, lack of parental controls halts the direct verification of the assumption of mating symmetry (MS) required to assess maternally-mediated effects. In this study, we used simulations to investigate the performance of existing methods under mating asymmetry (MA) when parents of controls are missing. Our results show that the log-linear, likelihood-based framework using a case-triad/case-control hybrid design provides valid tests for maternal genetic effects even under MA. Using this approach, we examined fetomaternal associations between 29 SNPs in 12 cell-cycle genes and childhood pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We identified putative fetomaternal effects at loci CDKN2A rs36228834 (P = .017) and CDKN2B rs36229158 (P = .022) that modulate the risk of childhood ALL. These data further corroborate the importance of the mother's genotype on the susceptibility to early-onset diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D054198", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "locations": [{"offset": 895, "length": 28}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "1029", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55430"}, "text": "CDKN2A", "locations": [{"offset": 983, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "rs36228834", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs36228834", "locations": [{"offset": 990, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "1030", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55859"}, "text": "CDKN2B", "locations": [{"offset": 1016, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "rs36229158", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs36229158", "locations": [{"offset": 1023, "length": 10}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 20617153, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["gene@1030", "gene@1029", "mutation@rs36228834", "mutation@rs36229158", "disease@MESH:D007938", "disease@MESH:D054198"], "journal": "J.
