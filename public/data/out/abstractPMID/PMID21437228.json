It occurs most commonly in the long bones, although there is variability in location between age groups. The etiology of osteosarcoma is not well understood; it occurs at increased rates in individuals with Paget disease of bone, after therapeutic radiation, and in certain cancer predisposition syndromes. It also occurs more commonly in taller individuals, but a strong environmental component to osteosarcoma risk has not been identified. Several studies suggest that osteosarcoma may be associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes important in growth and tumor suppression but the studies are limited by sample size. Herein, we review the epidemiology of osteosarcoma as well as its known and suspected risk factors in an effort to gain insight into its etiology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012516", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Osteosarcoma", "locations": [{"offset": 69, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001859", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "bone malignancy", "locations": [{"offset": 95, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012516", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "osteosarcoma", "locations": [{"offset": 326, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009369", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 479, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012516", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "osteosarcoma", "locations": [{"offset": 604, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012516", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "osteosarcoma", "locations": [{"offset": 676, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009369", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "tumor", "locations": [{"offset": 777, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012516", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "osteosarcoma", "locations": [{"offset": 877, "length": 12}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 21437228, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D012516", "disease@MESH:D001859", "disease@MESH:D009369"], "journal": "Sarcoma", "year": 2011, "authors": ["Savage SA", "Mirabello L"]}
