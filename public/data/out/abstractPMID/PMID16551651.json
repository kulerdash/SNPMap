We aimed to replicate these findings in a general population sample. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cross-sectional associations were assessed in a study of 3404 women from 23 towns across Britain who were aged 60-79 at the time of assessment and were described as white by the examining nurse. Women with the T-A haplotype [constructed from two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron of ESR1: c454-397T &gt; C (rs2234693) and c454-351A &gt; G (rs9340799)], which was predicted to be associated with reduced oestrogen response, were more likely to have been past [per haplotype odds ratio 1.16 (95% CI 1.01, 1.33), P = 0.02] or to be current users [per haplotype odds ratio 1.19 (95% CI 0.99, 1.42), P = 0.05] of hormone replacement. However, there was no association between haplotype or either SNP and HDL-c or other cardiovascular disease risk factors and no statistical evidence of an interaction between hormone replacement use and haplotype or either SNP with respect to HDL-c or any other cardiovascular disease risk factors. CONCLUSION: Women with the T-A haplotype are more likely to use hormone replacement. However, genotyping of ESR1 rs2234693 or rs9340799 in post-menopausal women to tailor hormone replacement is unlikely to markedly improve cardiovascular risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 166, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003324", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronary heart disease", "locations": [{"offset": 189, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 284, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 538, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Women", "locations": [{"offset": 671, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 784, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 808, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 841, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002318", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cardiovascular disease", "locations": [{"offset": 1215, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002318", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cardiovascular disease", "locations": [{"offset": 1392, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Women", "locations": [{"offset": 1441, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 1537, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 1542, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 1555, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1584, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 16551651, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["mutation@rs2234693", "gene@2099", "disease@MESH:D003324", "species@9606", "mutation@rs9340799", "disease@MESH:D002318"], "journal": "Eur.
