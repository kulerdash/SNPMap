However, a single polymorphism is likely to exhibit a modest effect. Therefore, we applied a pathway-based approach to evaluate the cumulative effect of multiple polymorphisms on clinical outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: We genotyped 25 functional polymorphisms in 16 key genes involved in cisplatin metabolism and action and evaluated their associations with overall survival in 229 non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: Several biologically plausible main effects were identified in individual analysis. More importantly, when six polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair genes were analyzed jointly, a significant trend of reduced risk of death with decreasing number of putative unfavorable genotypes was observed (P for trend &lt; 0.001 and log rank P &lt; 0.001). Survival tree analysis revealed potential higher-order gene-gene interactions and categorized subgroups with dramatically different survival experiences, based on distinct genotype profiles. The median survival time was 78.5 months for terminal node 1 in the low-risk group, 15.1 months for terminal node 10 in the medium-risk group, and 6.7 months for terminal node 9 in the high-risk group (log rank P &lt; 0.001). We also constructed a prediction hazard model. The area under the curve increased from 0.71 (using clinical variables only) to 0.84 (using clinical, epidemiological, and genetic variations from survival tree analysis). CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the clinical potential of taking a pathway-based approach and using survival tree analytic approach to identify subgroups of patients with distinctly differing outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "12", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 432, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002289", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "non-small cell lung cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 446, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002945", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "cisplatin", "locations": [{"offset": 552, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008175", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cell lung cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 656, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 673, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002945", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "cisplatin", "locations": [{"offset": 703, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 965, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1888, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 18854777, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["chemical@MESH:D002945", "disease@MESH:D003643", "disease@MESH:D002289", "disease@MESH:D008175", "species@9606", "chemical@MESH:D010984"], "journal": "Pharmacogenet.
