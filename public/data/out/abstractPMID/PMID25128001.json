Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in estrogen receptors may be associated with the risk of male infertility. A variety of case control studies have been published evaluating this association. However, the accumulated studies have shown inconsistent conclusions. METHODS: To further determine the potential association between the four common SNPs (rs2234693, rs9340799, rs1256049 and rs4986938) in estrogen receptors gene and male infertility, this meta-analysis was performed according to the 10 published case control studies. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the strength of the associations. RESULTS: It was revealed that the sub-group analysis by the ethnicity, for the rs2234693, a significant association in the comparison of CC vs. TT (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.93), CT vs. TT (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.93) and CC + CT vs. TT (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.89) in the Asian population with male infertility. For rs9340799 polymorphism, increased risks were observed for the comparison of AA vs. GG (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.15-2.68) and AA vs. GA + GG (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02-1.88). For rs1256049 polymorphism, the comparison of the GA vs. GG (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.00-2.31) and AA + GA vs. GG (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.03-2.94), also increased risks present in Asian and Caucasian population, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The rs2234693C allele was associated with the decreased risk for male infertility; however, the rs9340799AA genotype and the rs1256049GA genotype were associated with an increased risk for male infertility.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007248", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "male infertility", "locations": [{"offset": 225, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007248", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "male infertility", "locations": [{"offset": 339, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 596, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 607, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "rs1256049", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs1256049", "locations": [{"offset": 618, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "rs4986938", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs4986938", "locations": [{"offset": 632, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007247", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infertility", "locations": [{"offset": 679, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 965, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007248", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "male infertility", "locations": [{"offset": 1185, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 1207, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005708", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "GA", "locations": [{"offset": 1335, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "rs1256049", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs1256049", "locations": [{"offset": 1379, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 1612, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007248", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "male infertility", "locations": [{"offset": 1673, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 1704, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "rs1256049", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs1256049", "locations": [{"offset": 1733, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007248", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "male infertility", "locations": [{"offset": 1797, "length": 16}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 25128001, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["mutation@rs2234693", "mutation@rs9340799", "chemical@MESH:D005708", "disease@MESH:D007247", "disease@MESH:D007248", "mutation@rs4986938", "mutation@rs1256049"], "journal": "Reprod.
