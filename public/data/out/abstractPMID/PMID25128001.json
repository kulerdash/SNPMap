Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in estrogen receptors may be associated with the risk of male infertility. A variety of case control studies have been published evaluating this association. However, the accumulated studies have shown inconsistent conclusions. METHODS: To further determine the potential association between the four common SNPs (rs2234693, rs9340799, rs1256049 and rs4986938) in estrogen receptors gene and male infertility, this meta-analysis was performed according to the 10 published case control studies. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to evaluate the strength of the associations. RESULTS: It was revealed that the sub-group analysis by the ethnicity, for the rs2234693, a significant association in the comparison of CC vs. TT (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40-0.93), CT vs. TT (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.49-0.93) and CC + CT vs. TT (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.89) in the Asian population with male infertility. For rs9340799 polymorphism, increased risks were observed for the comparison of AA vs. GG (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.15-2.68) and AA vs. GA + GG (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02-1.88). For rs1256049 polymorphism, the comparison of the GA vs. GG (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.00-2.31) and AA + GA vs. GG (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.03-2.94), also increased risks present in Asian and Caucasian population, respectively.
