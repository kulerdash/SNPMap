A total of 5448 unrelated Japanese individuals from two independent populations were examined: subject panel A comprised 4252 individuals who visited participating hospitals; subject panel B comprised 1196 community-dwelling elderly individuals. The genotypes for 95 polymorphisms of 67 candidate genes were determined. The chi(2) test revealed that six polymorphisms were related (p&lt;0.05) to the prevalence of obesity in subject panel A; after application of Bonferroni's correction, however, only the 2677G --&gt; A/T polymorphism (rs2032582) of the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1 gene (ABCB1) was significantly associated (p=0.0003) with obesity. Subsequent multivariable logistic regression analysis also revealed that the 2677G --&gt; A/T polymorphism of ABCB1 was significantly associated with obesity. For validation of this association, the 2677G --&gt; A/T polymorphism of ABCB1 was examined in subject panel B and again found to be significantly associated with obesity. Body mass index was significantly (p=0.01) greater for individuals with the variant T allele of this polymorphism than for those with the GG genotype in the combined subject panels A and B. Our results suggest that the ABCB1 genotype may prove informative for assessment of genetic risk for obesity in Japanese individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009765", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "obesity", "locations": [{"offset": 171, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009765", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "obesity", "locations": [{"offset": 594, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2032582", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2032582", "locations": [{"offset": 717, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "5243", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55496"}, "text": "ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1", "locations": [{"offset": 735, "length": 43}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "5243", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55496"}, "text": "ABCB1", "locations": [{"offset": 785, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009765", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "obesity", "locations": [{"offset": 837, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "5243", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55496"}, "text": "ABCB1", "locations": [{"offset": 956, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009765", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "obesity", "locations": [{"offset": 996, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "5243", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55496"}, "text": "ABCB1", "locations": [{"offset": 1078, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009765", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "obesity", "locations": [{"offset": 1168, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "5243", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55496"}, "text": "ABCB1", "locations": [{"offset": 1396, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009765", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "obesity", "locations": [{"offset": 1468, "length": 7}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 18442890, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["mutation@rs2032582", "disease@MESH:D009765", "gene@5243"], "journal": "Genomics", "year": 2008, "authors": ["Ichihara S", "Yamada Y", "Kato K", "Hibino T", "Yokoi K", "Matsuo H", "Kojima T", "Watanabe S", "Metoki N", "Yoshida H", "Satoh K", "Aoyagi Y", "Yasunaga A", "Park H", "Tanaka M", "Nozawa Y"]}
