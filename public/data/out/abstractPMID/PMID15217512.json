Because breast cancer development is dependent on oestrogenic influence, we have investigated whether polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) are associated with breast cancer risk. METHODS: We genotyped breast cancer cases and age-matched population controls for one microsatellite marker and four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ESR1. The numbers of genotyped cases and controls for each marker were as follows: TAn, 1514 cases and 1514 controls; c.454-397C --&gt; T, 1557 cases and 1512 controls; c.454-351A --&gt; G, 1556 cases and 1512 controls; c.729C --&gt; T, 1562 cases and 1513 controls; c.975C --&gt; G, 1562 cases and 1513 controls. Using logistic regression models, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Haplotype effects were estimated in an exploratory analysis, using expectation-maximisation algorithms for case-control study data. RESULTS: There were no compelling associations between single polymorphic loci and breast cancer risk. In haplotype analyses, a common haplotype of the c.454-351A --&gt; G or c.454-397C --&gt; T and c.975C --&gt; G SNPs appeared to be associated with an increased risk for ductal breast cancer: one copy of the c.454-351A --&gt; G and c.975C --&gt; G haplotype entailed an OR of 1.19 (95% CI 1.06-1.33) and two copies with an OR of 1.42 (95% CI 1.15-1.77), compared with no copies, under a model of multiplicative penetrance. The association with the c.454-397C --&gt; T and c.975C --&gt; G haplotypes was similar. Our data indicated that these haplotypes were more influential in women with a high body mass index. Adjustment for multiple comparisons rendered the associations statistically non-significant. CONCLUSION: We found suggestions of an association between common haplotypes in ESR1 and the risk for ductal breast cancer that is stronger in heavy women.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 235, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 381, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 407, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 449, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 586, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1217, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "ductal breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1407, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 1815, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 2023, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "ductal breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 2045, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 2092, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 15217512, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["gene@2099", "disease@MESH:D001943", "species@9606"], "journal": "Breast Cancer Res.", "year": 2004, "authors": ["Wedr\u00e9n S", "Lovmar L", "Humphreys K", "Magnusson C", "Melhus H", "Syv\u00e4nen AC", "Kindmark A", "Landegren U", "Ferm\u00e9r ML", "Stiger F", "Persson I", "Baron J", "Weiderpass E"]}
