Genetic polymorphisms have been known to influence therapeutic response and risk of disease pathologies. Genetic screening for therapeutic and diagnostic applications thus holds great promise in clinical management. The allele-specific primer extension (ASPE) reaction was used to assay 22 multiplexed SNPs for eight subjects. Comparison of the microsphere-based ASPE assay results to sequencing results showed complete concordance in genotype assignments. The Bioplex suspension array thus proves to be a reliable, cost-effective and high-throughput technological platform for genotyping. It can be easily adapted to customized SNP panels for specific applications involving large-scale mutation screening of clinically relevant markers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 18213362, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": [], "journal": "Biol Proced Online", "year": 2007, "authors": ["Koo SH", "Ong TC", "Chong KT", "Lee CG", "Chew FT", "Lee EJ"]}
