OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to establish whether ESR1 polymorphisms influence fat mass in childhood. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional analysis after genotyping of rs9340799, rs2234693, and rs7757956 ESR1 polymorphisms. SETTING: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was a population-based prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 3097 11-yr-old children with results for ESR1 genotyping, puberty measures, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry results. OUTCOMES: Relationships between ESR1 polymorphisms and indices of body composition were measured. RESULTS: The rs7757956 polymorphism was associated with fat mass (P = 0.002). Total body fat mass (adjusted for height) was reduced by 6% in children with TA/AA genotypes, and risk of being overweight (&gt; or =85th centile of fat mass) was decreased by 20%. This genetic effect appeared to interact with puberty in girls (P = 0.05 for interaction): in those with the TT genotype, total body fat mass (adjusted for height) was 18% higher in Tanner stages 3-5 vs. stages 1-2; the equivalent difference was 7% in those with TA/AA genotypes. Furthermore, the risk of being overweight was 36% lower in girls with TA/AA genotypes in Tanner stages 3-5, but no reduction was seen in those in stages 1-2. Neither rs9340799 nor rs2234693 polymorphisms were associated with body composition measures. CONCLUSIONS: Fat mass in 11-yr-old children was related to the rs7757956 ESR1 polymorphism. This association was strongest in girls in more advanced puberty, in whom the risk of being overweight was reduced by 36% in those with the TA/AA genotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 126, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha", "locations": [{"offset": 145, "length": 28}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 281, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 397, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 408, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "rs7757956", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs7757956", "locations": [{"offset": 423, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 433, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Children", "locations": [{"offset": 505, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "PARTICIPANTS", "locations": [{"offset": 565, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Participants", "locations": [{"offset": 579, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 616, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 642, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 755, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "rs7757956", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs7757956", "locations": [{"offset": 834, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 962, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "42", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "girls", "locations": [{"offset": 1137, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "43", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "girls", "locations": [{"offset": 1419, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "44", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 1526, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "45", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 1540, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "46", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 1647, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "47", "infons": {"identifier": "rs7757956", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs7757956", "locations": [{"offset": 1675, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "48", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 1685, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "49", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "girls", "locations": [{"offset": 1738, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 17405848, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["mutation@rs2234693", "gene@2099", "mutation@rs7757956", "species@9606", "mutation@rs9340799"], "journal": "J.
