Additionally, variants in the transcribed region, termed here 'structural RNA SNPs' (srSNPs), can affect mRNA processing and turnover. Both rSNPs and srSNPs cause allelic mRNA expression imbalance (AEI) in heterozygous individuals. We have used AEI to discover and characterize regulatory polymorphisms in OPRM1, TPH2, MDR1, DRD2, and VKORC1. The objective of this study was to use AEI to determine the extent of cis-regulatory factors in pharmacogenetic genes. METHODS: We applied a rapid and accurate AEI methodology for testing 42 genes implicated in cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases, and affecting drug metabolism and transport. Each gene was analyzed in physiologically relevant human autopsy tissues, including brain, heart, liver, intestines, and lymphocytes. RESULTS: Substantial AEI was observed in approximately 55% of the surveyed genes. Focusing on cardiovascular candidate genes in human hearts, AEI analysis revealed frequent cis-acting regulatory factors in ACE and SOD2 mRNA expression, having potential clinical significance. SNP scanning to locate regulatory polymorphisms in a number of genes failed to support several previously proposed promoter SNPs discovered with use of reporter gene assays in heterologous tissues, while srSNPs appear more frequent than expected. Computational analysis of mRNA folding indicates that approximately 90% of srSNPs affect mRNA folding, and hence potentially function. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that both rSNPs and srSNPs represent a still largely untapped reservoir of variants that contribute to human phenotypic diversity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 245, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "4988", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "37368"}, "text": "OPRM1", "locations": [{"offset": 692, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "121278", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "27831"}, "text": "TPH2", "locations": [{"offset": 699, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "5243", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55496"}, "text": "MDR1", "locations": [{"offset": 705, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "1813", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "22561"}, "text": "DRD2", "locations": [{"offset": 711, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "79001", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "11416"}, "text": "VKORC1", "locations": [{"offset": 721, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002318", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 940, "length": 50}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 1088, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 1299, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "1636", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "37351"}, "text": "ACE", "locations": [{"offset": 1377, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "6648", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "530"}, "text": "SOD2", "locations": [{"offset": 1385, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 1965, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 18698231, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["gene@6648", "gene@1636", "gene@1813", "gene@121278", "gene@79001", "species@9606", "gene@4988", "gene@5243", "disease@MESH:D002318"], "journal": "Pharmacogenet.
