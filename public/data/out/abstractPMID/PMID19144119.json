It is speculated that these conflicting results may have arisen due to different patient subgroups and ethnicities studied. For the first time, this study explores the effect of the MDM2 SNP309 genotype on Taiwanese breast cancer patients. METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from the whole blood of 124 breast cancer patients and 97 cancer-free healthy women living in Taiwan. MDM2 SNP309 genotyping was carried out by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. The multivariate logistic regression and the Kaplan-Meier method were used for analyzing the risk association and significance of age at diagnosis among different MDM2 SNP309 genotypes, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to the TT genotype, an increased risk association with breast cancer was apparent for the GG genotype (OR = 3.05, 95% CI = 1.04 to 8.95), and for the TG genotype (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 0.90 to 5.00) after adjusting for age, cardiovascular disease/diabetes, oral contraceptive usage, and body mass index, which exhibits significant difference between cases and controls. Furthermore, the average ages at diagnosis for breast cancer patients were 53.6, 52 and 47 years for those harboring TT, TG and GG genotypes, respectively. A significant difference in median age of onset for breast cancer between GG and TT+TG genotypes was obtained by the log-rank test (p = 0.0067). CONCLUSION: Findings based on the current sample size suggest that the MDM2 SNP309 GG genotype may be associated with both the risk of breast cancer and an earlier age of onset in Taiwanese women.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "4193", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "1793"}, "text": "MDM2", "locations": [{"offset": 353, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009369", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "tumor", "locations": [{"offset": 380, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 424, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 576, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "4193", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "1793"}, "text": "MDM2", "locations": [{"offset": 677, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 711, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 725, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 797, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 811, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009369", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 827, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 847, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "4193", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "1793"}, "text": "MDM2", "locations": [{"offset": 871, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"identifier": "4193", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "1793"}, "text": "MDM2", "locations": [{"offset": 1131, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "42", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1241, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "43", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002318", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "cardiovascular disease", "locations": [{"offset": 1408, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "44", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003920", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "diabetes", "locations": [{"offset": 1431, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "45", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1601, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "46", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1615, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "47", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1762, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "48", "infons": {"identifier": "-", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "TT+TG", "locations": [{"offset": 1791, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "49", "infons": {"identifier": "4193", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "1793"}, "text": "MDM2", "locations": [{"offset": 1926, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "50", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001943", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "breast cancer", "locations": [{"offset": 1990, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "51", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "women", "locations": [{"offset": 2045, "length": 5}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 19144119, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["gene@4193", "chemical@-", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D001943", "disease@MESH:D002318", "disease@MESH:D003920", "disease@MESH:D009369"], "journal": "BMC Cancer", "year": 2009, "authors": ["Sun YF", "Leu JD", "Chen SM", "Lin IF", "Lee YJ"]}
