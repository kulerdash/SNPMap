Some of them are known, but their functional roles still requireinvestigation. Age is a recognized risk factor; children with disease onset after the age of ten have worse prognosis, presumably also triggered by inherited factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MDR1 gene polymorphisms rs1045642, rs2032582 and MTHFR gene polymorphisms rs1801131 and rs1801133 were genotyped in 68 ALL patients in remission and 102 age and gender matched controls; parental DNA samples were also available for 42 probands. RESULTS: No case control association was found between analyzed polymorphisms and a risk of childhood ALL development. Linkage disequilibrium was not observed in a family-based association study either. Only marginal association was observed between genetic marker rs2032582A and later disease onset (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that late age of ALL onset could be triggered by mild effect common alleles.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D054198", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "locations": [{"offset": 131, "length": 28}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "children", "locations": [{"offset": 432, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "5243", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "55496"}, "text": "MDR1", "locations": [{"offset": 578, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "rs1045642", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs1045642", "locations": [{"offset": 602, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2032582", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2032582", "locations": [{"offset": 613, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "4524", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "4349"}, "text": "MTHFR", "locations": [{"offset": 627, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "rs1801131", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs1801131", "locations": [{"offset": 652, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "rs1801133", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs1801133", "locations": [{"offset": 666, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 701, "length": 8}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 25520092, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["mutation@rs1801131", "species@9606", "mutation@rs2032582", "mutation@rs1801133", "gene@4524", "mutation@rs1045642", "gene@5243", "disease@MESH:D054198"], "journal": "Asian Pac.
