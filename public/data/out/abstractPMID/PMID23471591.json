A meta-analysis was performed to quantitative analysis the association of ESR1 gene polymorphisms and CHD risk using previous case-control studies in Chinese Han population. METHODS: Several electronic databases were searched for relevant articles up to August 2012. After data collection, a meta-analysis was performed to assess heterogeneity, combine results and evaluate variations. Different effect models were used according to the difference in heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis was assessed by omitting one study at a time. Publication bias was examined using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test. RESULTS: Ten studies covering 3400 subjects on rs2234693 and rs9340799 polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene with CHD risk was included in this meta-analysis. For rs2234693 polymorphism, ten studies were combined to the meta-analysis. A significantly increased CHD risk was found in a dominant model (OR=1.35, 955 CI=1.01-1.81, P=0.05), recessive model (OR=1.40, 95% CI=1.15-1.69, P=0.0007), and additive model (OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.19-2.34, P=0.003). Subgroup for male but not for female showed that the CC genotype could increase the risk of CHD compared with TT and TC genotype in Chinese Han population. Concerning rs9340799 polymorphism, eight studies were combined to the meta-analysis. And no evidence of significant association with CHD risk was found in all genetic models. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of 10 studies involving Chinese Han population suggests that the CC genotype of the ESR1 rs2234693 polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD in males only. There was no evidence however, of a significant association between the ESR1 rs9340799 polymorphism and CHD risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [{"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 229, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 239, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 253, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003324", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coronary heart disease", "locations": [{"offset": 282, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 306, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 467, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 495, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "38", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 1064, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "39", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 1078, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "40", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 1109, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "41", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 1124, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "42", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 1173, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "43", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 1271, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "44", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 1551, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "45", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013667", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "TC", "locations": [{"offset": 1576, "length": 2}]}, {"id": "46", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 1626, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "47", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 1748, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "48", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 1904, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "49", "infons": {"identifier": "rs2234693", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs2234693", "locations": [{"offset": 1909, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "50", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 1986, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "51", "infons": {"identifier": "2099", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "47906"}, "text": "ESR1", "locations": [{"offset": 2077, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "52", "infons": {"identifier": "rs9340799", "type": "Mutation", "subtype": "SNP"}, "text": "rs9340799", "locations": [{"offset": 2082, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "53", "infons": {"type": "Disease", "identifier": null, "db": null}, "text": "CHD", "locations": [{"offset": 2109, "length": 3}]}], "relations": []}], "relations": [], "pmid": 23471591, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1592598838791}, "accessions": ["mutation@rs2234693", "gene@2099", "disease@MESH:D003324", "chemical@MESH:D013667", "mutation@rs9340799"], "journal": "Int J Med Sci", "year": 2013, "authors": ["Wei CD", "Zheng HY", "Wu W", "Dai W", "Tong YQ", "Wang M", "Li Y"]}
