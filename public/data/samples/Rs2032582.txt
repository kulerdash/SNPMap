[[rs2032582]], also known as G2677T, is a nonsynonymous SNP located in exon 21 of the [[ABCB1]] gene. G2677 is also known as Ala893Thr. It is often studied in conjunction with [[rs1045642]].

The [[rs2032582]](T) variant allele yields a 2.6 fold higher risk of developing [[lung cancer]], and in particular, the type of lung cancer called squamous cell carcinoma (CI 1.7-4.0, P < .001) in white Spanish smokers. There appears to be little gene dosage effect, since homozygous [[rs2032582(T;T)]] carriers shoulder almost all the risk (odds ratio 6.75 compared to (A;A) homozygotes, CI 3.0-15.2). This risk is also the same in light or heavy smokers. {{PMID|17120199}} 

A study of 98 methadone-maintaining patients concluded that the higher (>150 mg/day) and lower (< or=150 mg/day) [[methadone]] dose groups differed significantly in their [[rs1128503]] status (experiment-wise p=0.0325). Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs [[rs1045642]], [[rs2032582]] and [[rs1128503]], respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value=0.026).{{PMID|18424454|OA=1
