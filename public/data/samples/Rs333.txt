The chemokine receptor gene [[CCR5]] plays an important role in many immune-related processes. Delta 32 [[rs333]], designating the CCR5-delta32 deletion of 32 nucleotides from within the gene, is perhaps the most famous allele of [[CCR5]]. 23andMe tests for this under their private identifier/name, [[I3003626]].

Individuals carrying one copy of the delta 32 allele are somewhat resistant to infection by [[HIV]], the virus that causes [[AIDS]], and individuals with 2 copies (delta 32 homozygotes, ~1% of Caucasians) are almost completely immune to infection by HIV. {{PMID|8898752}} The delta 32 allele may have been selected for in European populations because it confers resistance to plague (Black Death) or smallpox. [http://www.pnas.org/content/100/25/15276.long]

[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMoa0807917 NEJM] suggests decreased risk of [[type 1 diabetes]] (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.72; P=1.88x10&#8211;6 with 2 df). 

Does the CCR5-delta32 mutation have an entirely positive/protective role?

Probably not. In patients with [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]] (AAA), the major risk is a sudden rupture - which is quite often fatal. Individuals with the delta 32 variant are more likely to have aneurysms than non-carriers, and among patients with aneurysms, delta 32 carriers are more likely to rupture than to be diagnosed in time for surgical repair. {{PMID|15557916}}

Tests for CCR-delta32 are offered by [http://www.familytreedna.com/advanced-test-results.aspx FamilyTreeDNA] ([http://www.familytreedna.com/faq/answers/default.aspx?faqid=8#518 FAQ]), [https://www.23andme.com/health/Resistance-to-HIV-AIDS/ 23andMe], and possibly other direct-to-consumer genetics testing companies.
